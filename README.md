## 📸 How It Works

1. User scans a medicine image
2. App finds **largest colorful text** (most likely medicine name)
3. Matches against **first column** in CSV
4. If match found:
   - Shows full row of details
   - Gives **vibration alert**
   - **Reads info aloud**
5. If not found:
   - Uses **string manipulation** (longest words etc.)
   - Tries again with second-best guesses
   - Else: "Medicine not found."
